FOPEN(3)                 Linux Programmer's Manual                 FOPEN(3)

NAME
       fopen, fdopen, freopen - stream open functions

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdio.h>

       FILE *fopen(const char *pathname, const char *mode);

       FILE *fdopen(int fd, const char *mode);

       FILE *freopen(const char *pathname, const char *mode, FILE *stream);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       fdopen(): _POSIX_C_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       The fopen() function opens the file whose name is the string pointed
       to by pathname and associates a stream with it.

       The argument mode points to a string beginning with one of the  fol‐
       lowing sequences (possibly followed by additional characters, as de‐
       scribed below):

       r      Open text file for reading.  The stream is positioned at  the
              beginning of the file.

       r+     Open  for  reading  and writing.  The stream is positioned at
              the beginning of the file.

       w      Truncate file to zero length or create text file for writing.
              The stream is positioned at the beginning of the file.

       w+     Open for reading and writing.  The file is created if it does
              not exist, otherwise it is truncated.  The  stream  is  posi‐
              tioned at the beginning of the file.
